This code attempts to access an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  This can lead to unexpected crashes or behavior if not handled correctly.

```objectivec
NSArray *myArray = @[@1, @2, @3];
NSInteger index = 4; // Out of bounds
NSInteger value = [myArray objectAtIndex:index]; // Crash!
```
